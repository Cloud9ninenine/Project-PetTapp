## Next Steps

1. **Test on Physical Device**
   - Install app on physical device
   - Test complete login/logout flow
   - Verify notifications work when app is closed
   - Check background fetch runs (wait 15-30 min)

2. **Monitor Logs**
   - Watch console for any errors
   - Verify all operations complete successfully
   - Check for any failed API calls

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Have real users test the flow
   - Gather feedback on experience
   - Monitor for any issues

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Build release version
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Deploy to stores

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Background Fetch**
   - iOS: Minimum 15 minute intervals
   - Android: System-dependent timing
   - Not guaranteed to run at exact intervals

2. **Notifications**
   - Require user permission
   - Can be disabled in system settings
   - Limited customization on some devices

3. **Storage**
   - AsyncStorage has size limits (~6MB typical)
   - Can be cleared by system on low storage
   - Not suitable for large data

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Ensure packages are installed:
   - expo-notifications
   - expo-device
   - expo-background-fetch
   - expo-task-manager
4. Test on physical device (not simulator)
5. Check device permissions for notifications
