## Verification Summary

### ✅ All Endpoints Verified:
- **Total Endpoints Found:** 45
- **Correctly Aligned:** 45
- **Needs Update:** 0

### HTTP Methods Used:
- **GET:** 27 endpoints
- **POST:** 7 endpoints
- **PUT:** 3 endpoints
- **PATCH:** 4 endpoints

## Best Practices Observed

✅ **Consistent API Structure:**
- All endpoints use proper REST conventions
- Proper HTTP methods for operations (GET for read, POST for create, PUT for update, PATCH for partial update, DELETE for delete)

✅ **Authentication:**
- All endpoints that require authentication are using `apiClient` which automatically adds Bearer token
- Auth headers are properly configured

✅ **Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks present in all API calls
- User-friendly error messages via Alert.alert()

✅ **Loading States:**
- Loading indicators shown during API calls
- Proper state management for async operations

---

## Recommendations

### Current State: ✅ No Action Required

All user-side APIs are correctly aligned with the backend. The mobile app is production-ready in terms of API integration.

### Future Enhancements (Optional):

1. **Add Missing New Features:**
   - Top-rated services endpoint (`GET /api/services/top-rated`)
   - Booking update/reschedule (`PUT /api/bookings/:id`)
   - Booking edit approval workflow

2. **Optimization:**
   - Consider adding request caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement request debouncing for search endpoints

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Add retry logic for failed requests
   - Implement offline mode handling

---

## Notes

- All file upload endpoints correctly use `multipart/form-data` headers
- Query parameters are properly passed using `params` object
- FormData is correctly constructed for file uploads
- All endpoints use the `/api` prefix automatically via `apiClient` base URL configuration

---

**Status:** ✅ **ALL APIS ALIGNED - NO CHANGES NEEDED**
