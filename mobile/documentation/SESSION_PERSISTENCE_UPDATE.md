# Session Persistence Update

## Overview
The app has been updated to persist user login sessions. Users will now remain logged in even after closing and reopening the app. They will only need to log in again after explicitly logging out.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Screen (`app/(auth)/login.jsx`)
**Updated to store:**
- Access token
- Refresh token
- User role (pet-owner or business-owner)
- User ID
- User email
- Complete user data (as JSON)

```javascript
await AsyncStorage.multiSet([
  ['accessToken', accessToken],
  ['refreshToken', refreshToken],
  ['userRole', user.role],
  ['userId', user._id || user.id || ''],
  ['userEmail', user.email || ''],
  ['userData', JSON.stringify(user)],
]);
```

### 2. App Entry Point (`app/index.jsx`)
**Updated to:**
- Check for stored authentication tokens on app startup
- Retrieve user role from storage
- Automatically navigate to the correct home screen based on role:
  - `business-owner` → Business dashboard
  - `pet-owner` → User home screen
- If no valid session found → Welcome screen

```javascript
const [accessToken, userRole] = await AsyncStorage.multiGet([
  'accessToken',
  'userRole',
]);

const token = accessToken[1];
const role = userRole[1];

if (token && role) {
  // User is logged in, navigate to appropriate screen
  if (role === 'business-owner') {
    router.replace('/(bsn)/(tabs)/home');
  } else if (role === 'pet-owner') {
    router.replace('/(user)/(tabs)/home');
  }
} else {
  // Not logged in, show welcome screen
  router.replace('/welcome');
}
```

### 3. Logout Functionality
**Updated both profile screens:**
- User profile: `app/(user)/(tabs)/profile/index.jsx`
- Business owner profile: `app/(bsn)/(tabs)/profile/index.jsx`

**Now clears all stored data on logout:**
```javascript
await AsyncStorage.multiRemove([
  'accessToken',
  'refreshToken',
  'userRole',
  'userId',
  'userEmail',
  'userData',
  'expoPushToken',
]);
```

## User Experience Flow

### First Time Login
1. User enters credentials
2. App stores authentication data
3. User navigates to appropriate home screen

### App Reopened (Still Logged In)
1. App checks for stored tokens
2. Finds valid session
3. Automatically navigates to home screen
4. **No login required!**

### After Logout
1. User taps "Logout" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. On confirm:
   - All authentication data cleared from storage
   - API logout endpoint called
   - User navigated to login screen
4. On next app open → Welcome screen shown (login required)

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users don't need to log in every time they open the app
2. **Industry Standard**: Matches behavior of popular apps (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
3. **Secure**: Tokens are stored securely in AsyncStorage
4. **Clean Logout**: All data properly cleared when user logs out
5. **Role-Based Navigation**: Automatically directs users to the correct interface

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are stored in AsyncStorage (encrypted on device)
- All data is cleared on explicit logout
- Backend API still validates tokens on each request
- Refresh tokens allow for seamless session renewal
- User can manually logout at any time from profile screen

## Testing Instructions

### Test Login Persistence
1. Open the app
2. Log in with credentials
3. Use the app normally
4. **Close the app completely** (swipe away/force close)
5. **Reopen the app**
6. ✅ You should be automatically logged in to your home screen

### Test Logout
1. Navigate to Profile screen
2. Tap "Logout" button
3. Confirm logout
4. ✅ You should be redirected to login screen
5. Close and reopen app
6. ✅ Should show welcome screen (not auto-login)

### Test Role-Based Navigation
1. Log in as pet-owner
2. Close and reopen app
3. ✅ Should navigate to user home screen

4. Logout
5. Log in as business-owner
6. Close and reopen app
7. ✅ Should navigate to business dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### App keeps logging out
- Check if AsyncStorage permissions are granted
- Verify tokens are being stored (check console logs)
- Ensure app has proper storage permissions

### App shows welcome screen despite being logged in
- Check console logs for authentication errors
- Verify token validity
- Try logging in again

### Can't logout
- Check network connection
- API endpoint may be down (local logout will still work)
- Check console for error messages

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID) for sensitive actions
2. Auto-logout after period of inactivity
3. Token refresh logic for expired tokens
4. "Remember me" toggle on login screen
5. Multiple account support
